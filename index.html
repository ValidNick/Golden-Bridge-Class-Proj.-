			<h2>Welcome to the Golden Bridge. Come see what all the hypes about!</h2>
			<p>The Golden Gate Bridge is an iconic building that connects the city of San Francisco with Marin County, California. It stretches about two miles across the Golden Gate, a narrow strait that San Francisco Bay opens to meet the Pacific Ocean. The dream of connecting San Francisco and its northern neighbors came true when construction began in 1933. Faced with the opportunity to become a full-time employee in the midst of the Great Depression, builders faced a dangerous situation as roads and towers were shaped over the open ocean. Open to the public in 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge is a scenic landmark and has endured the challenges of time as  an engineering wonder.</p>
